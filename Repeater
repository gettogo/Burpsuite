Inspector is a supplementary feature to the Request and Response views in the Repeater module. It is also used to obtain a visually organized breakdown of requests and responses, as well as for experimenting to see how changes made using the higher-level Inspector affect the equivalent raw versions.


Other sections available for viewing and/or editing include:

    Request Query Parameters: These refer to data sent to the server via the URL. For example, in a GET request like https://admin.tryhackme.com/?redirect=false, the query parameter redirect has a value of "false".
    Request Body Parameters: Similar to query parameters, but specific to POST requests. Any data sent as part of a POST request will be displayed in this section, allowing us to modify the parameters before resending.
    Request Cookies: This section contains a modifiable list of cookies sent with each request.
    Request Headers: It enables us to view, access, and modify (including adding or removing) any headers sent with our requests. Editing these headers can be valuable when examining how a web server responds to unexpected headers.
    Response Headers: This section displays the headers returned by the server in response to our request. It cannot be modified, as we have no control over the headers returned by the server. Note that this section becomes visible only after sending a request and receiving a response.



Among these components, the sections pertaining to the request can typically be modified, enabling the addition, editing, and removal of items. For instance, in the Request Attributes section, we can alter elements related to the location, method, and protocol of the request. This includes modifying the desired resource to retrieve, changing the HTTP method from GET to another variant, or switching the protocol from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2:
